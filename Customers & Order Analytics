In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

/*1 - how many ordes were placed in January?*/

Select COUNT(*)
From BIT_DB.JanSales;


/*2- how many of those orders were an iphone?*/

Select count (*)
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where product = 'iPhone';


/*3- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.*/

Select c.acctnum
From BIT_DB.FebSales s
Inner Join BIT_DB.customers c
ON s.orderID = c.order_id;


/*4- which product was the cheapest one sold in january and what was the price?*/

select Product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
Where Price in 
(Select Min( Price) 
From BIT_DB.JanSales)
Limit 1;
 
/*or*/

SELECT product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;


/* 5- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?*/

Select Sum(quantity) * Price as Revenue
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by Product;


/*6- Whih products were sold in February at '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101', how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?*/
select sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


/*7- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at the time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?*/

select count(distinct cust.acctnum) as How_many, avg(quantity*price) as Average_price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


/*8- List all products sold in Los Angeles in February, include how many of each were sold*/

Select Product, SUM(Quantity)
From BIT_DB.FebSales
Where Location like'%Los Angeles%'
Group By product;
