In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

/*1 - how many ordes were placed in January?*/

Select COUNT(*)
From BIT_DB.JanSales;

/*2- how many of those orders were an iphone?*/

Select count (*)
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where product = 'iPhone';

/*3- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.*/

Select c.acctnum
From BIT_DB.FebSales s
Inner Join BIT_DB.customers c
ON s.orderID = c.order_id;

/*4- which product was the cheapest one sold in january and what was the price?*/

select Product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
Where Price in 
(Select Min( Price) 
From BIT_DB.JanSales)
Limit 1;
 
/*or*/

SELECT product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

/* 5- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?*/

Select Sum(quantity) * Price as Revenue
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by Product;

/*6- Whih products were sold in February at '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101', how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?*/

select sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

/*7- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at the time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?*/

select count(distinct cust.acctnum) as How_many, avg(quantity*price) as Average_price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/*8- List all products sold in Los Angeles in February, include how many of each were sold*/

Select Product, SUM(Quantity)
From BIT_DB.FebSales
Where Location like'%Los Angeles%'
Group By product;

/*9- Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).*/

Select Distinct Location, Count(OrderID)
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where Location like '%New York%'
Group by Location
Having Count(OrderID) >= 3;

/*10- How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?*/

Select SUM(Quantity) As How_Many, Product
From BIT_DB.FebSales
Where Product like '%Headphones%'
Group By Product; 

/*11- What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)*/

Select Sum(Quantity*price)/Count(C.acctnum)
From BIT_DB.FebSales S
Left JOIN BIT_DB.customers C
On S.orderID = C.order_id
Where length (orderid) = 6
And orderid <> 'Order ID';

/*or*/

SELECT Avg(Quantity*Price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/*12- What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).*/

Select SUM(Quantity)/Count(C.acctnum) 
as Average_Quatity_Per_Account
From BIT_DB.FebSales S
Left JOIN BIT_DB.customers C
On S.orderID = C.order_id
Where length (orderid) = 6
And orderid <> 'Order ID';

/*13- Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?*/

Select Product, SUM(quantity*price) as Revenue
From BIT_DB.JanSales
Where length (orderid) = 6
Group by Product
Order by Price Desc
