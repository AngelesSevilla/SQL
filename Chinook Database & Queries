In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customers, employees, invoices, and order data.

--1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the USA.

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
Where Country <> 'USA';


--2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';


--3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT I.InvoiceId, I.InvoiceDate, C.FirstName ||' '|| C.LastName AS FullName, I.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers c
Join chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE C.Country = 'Brazil';


--4.Show the Employees who work in sales.

SELECT *
FROM Chinook.employees E
Where Title LIKe 'Sales%';


--5.Find list all unique billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT Distinct(BillingCountry)
FROM chinook.invoices;


--6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT E.LastName ||', '|| E.FirstName As Sale_Agent_Full_Name, I.InvoiceId
FROM Chinook.employees E
JOIN chinook.customers C
ON E.EmployeeID = C.SupportRepID
Join chinook.invoices I
ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId;


--7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT I.InvoiceId, C.FirstName ||'  '|| C.LastName AS Customer_Name, I.Total, C.Country, E.FirstName ||'  '|| E.LastName As Sales_Agent_Name
FROM employees E
JOIN customers C
ON E.EmployeeId = C.SupportRepId
Join invoices I
ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
Order By I.InvoiceDate;


--8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


--9.What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


--10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT I.InvoiceLineId, T.Name
FROM chinook.invoice_Items I
Join chinook.tracks T
ON I.TrackId = T.TrackId
Order By I.InvoiceLineId;


--11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT I.InvoiceLineId, T.Name As Track_Name, Ar.Name AS Artist_Name
FROM chinook.Invoice_items I
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks T
ON I.TrackId = T.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums Al
ON Al.AlbumId = T.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists Ar
ON Ar.ArtistId = Al.ArtistId;


--12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT T.TrackID, T.Name As Track_Name, A.Title AS Album_Title, M.Name AS Media_Type, G.Name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks T
JOIN chinook.albums A
ON T.AlbumID = A.AlbumID
JOIN chinook.media_types M
ON M.MediaTypeID = T.MediatypeID
JOIN chinook.genres G
ON G.GenreID = T.GenreID;

--13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT E.FirstName||' '|| E.LastName AS Sales_Agent_Name, COUNT(*) AS Total_Sales, Round(SUM(I.Total)) AS Total_Profit
FROM Chinook.employees E
JOIN chinook.customers C
ON E.EmployeeID = C.SupportRepID
Join chinook.invoices I
ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
Group by E.EmployeeID;

--14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT E.FirstName||' '|| E.LastName AS Sales_Agent_Name, Round(SUM(I.Total)) AS Total_Profit
FROM Chinook.employees E
JOIN chinook.customers C
ON E.EmployeeID = C.SupportRepID
Join chinook.invoices I
ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
Group by E.EmployeeID
Order by Total_profit desc
Limit 1;
