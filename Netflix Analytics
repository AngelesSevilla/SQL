In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data.


/*How many columns in the database*/

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"
Limit 3;


/*IN unalphatetical order, find out the last 7 directors, titles produced and its rating.*/

SELECT cnp.director, cnti.title, cnti.rating
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" cnp
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" cnti
ON cnp.show_id = cnti.show_id
ORDER BY cnp.director DESC
Limit 7;


/*How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)*/

SELECT COUNT (title)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE Type = 'Movie';


/*When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?*/

SELECT cnti.date_added
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" as cnp
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" as cnti
ON cnp.show_id = cnti.show_id
ORDER BY cnti.release_year DESC
Limit 1;

/*Or*/

select max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";


/*List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.*/

SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;


/*Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?*/

select cnp.Director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" cnp
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" cnti
ON cnp.show_id=cnti.show_id
WHERE cnti.title='Bright Star';


/*What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?*/

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;

/*Or*/

SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= 
(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
